游릭 2. State Management (Local)
useState basics

Primitive vs object state

useEffect with empty dependency []

Dependency array logic

Fetching APIs

Timers and intervals

Holding mutable state across renders

游릭 5. useContext + Global State
Context Provider + Consumer

When to use Context vs Props

Theme switcher example

Avoiding prop drilling

游릭 6. useReducer
useReducer vs useState

Reducer function + dispatch

State transitions + action types

When to choose this over Redux

游릭 7. Custom Hooks
Why create your own hooks?

Extracting logic from components

Naming rules (useX)

Reusability patterns

游릭 8. React Router v6+

React Testing Library

Unit testing vs integration

Testing props, events, API calls

Mocking and coverage reports

游릭 15. Dev Tools + Build
Vite vs CRA

Webpack overview

Absolute paths

.env files

Folder structure (feature-based, atomic)

游릭 16. Deployment

CRA build folder

Hosting static files

Azure Static Web Apps (optional)

Environment variables in deployment

游릭 17. PWA Integration (Optional)
